NativeScript plugins showcase
-----------------------------

## What's this?
Glad you asked. I need it to demo a few plugins and wanted to play a bit with NativeScript & Angular.

## CanIUse?
This app is in active development and optimized for **iOS** only at the moment.

> Well, it works on Android, but some UI elements are off so I don't recommend installing it there yet. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/nativescript-pluginshowcase
cd nativescript-pluginshowcase
tns run ios [--emulator]
```
